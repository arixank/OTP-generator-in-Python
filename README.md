# OTP-generator-in-Python
This is a very simple OTP generator !! It's a good start for a beginner pythonista !!
It doesen't use any external libraries, just made use of the string library to get my work done in adding the numbers rahter than typing all the way to 0-9 !!
And this is just a skeltal structure for how a possible OTP or generators work in general !!

Things to keep in Mind:
OTP.py - is the basic logical structure
OTPgen.py - is the actual generator!

This was done in order to understand the basics and framing a robust logic.
